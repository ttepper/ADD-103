        <h2>Skills and Experience</h2>

        <p class="white-text">I am a motivated and dedicated Computer Science student with strong technical, creative, and problem-solving skills. 
            I have experience working with programming languages such as C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am comfortable building user-friendly websites and applications that solve real-world challenges. 
            My strengths include web development, front-end design, software engineering concepts, and a strong ability to learn new technologies quickly and efficiently. 
            I am passionate about expanding my knowledge, taking on new challenges, and pushing myself to improve both technically and creatively. 
            In the future, I aspire to work in software development, front-end web design, or even game development, where I can combine my technical skills with innovative thinking to create meaningful solutions.</p>

        <p class="white-text">My resume highlights my education, technical skills, and project experience, reflecting my dedication to continuous learning and growth. 
            Outside of academics, I have developed strong leadership abilities through sports, teamwork, and group collaborations, which have helped me strengthen both my problem-solving and communication skills. 
            I am committed to applying these experiences to real-world projects and professional environments as I continue to grow in my career.</p>
