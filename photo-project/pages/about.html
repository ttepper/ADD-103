                <p>Hello! My name is Tyler Tepper, and I am a passionate Computer Science student who loves exploring the world of technology, creativity, and problem-solving. I have always been fascinated by how things work behind the scenes, which naturally led me to pursue programming and web development.
                    Throughout my studies, I have developed skills in C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building clean, functional websites and applications that create a great experience for users. I am especially interested in software engineering, front-end design, and learning more about databases and data structures.
                    When I’m not coding, I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing sports like football, and hanging out with friends and family. I also love solving puzzles, whether that’s through a Rubik’s Cube or tackling a challenging coding project. I believe that continuous learning is the key to growth, and I am always excited to take on new challenges that push me to improve.
                    In the future, I hope to work in software development, web design, or even game development. I am currently working on expanding my portfolio with personal and academic projects to showcase my skills and creativity. I am excited for what lies ahead in my journey as a Computer Science professional and look forward to making a positive impact wherever I go.
                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio site and learning a little more about me!
