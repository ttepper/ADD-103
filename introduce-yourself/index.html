        <p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Tyler Tepper, and I am excited to share a little bit about myself, my passions, and my journey. I have always been someone who enjoys learning, whether it's about technology, fitness, or simply experiencing new things in life. My interests range from spending quality time with family and friends to diving deep into computer science and web development.
            Currently, I am working on improving my programming skills, specifically in C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            My goal is to build a strong foundation that will help me pursue a career in software engineering or web development. 
            Besides coding, I am passionate about fitness and am actively working on achieving my personal health goals.
        </p>
