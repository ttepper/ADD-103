                Hello! My name is Tyler Tepper, and I’m passionate about technology, fitness, and personal growth. Ever since I was young, I’ve been drawn to problem-solving and technology, whether it was figuring out how things worked or experimenting with different gadgets and software. This curiosity naturally led me to explore the world of programming and web development, and over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in software engineering.
                Currently, I am actively learning and improving my skills in C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, working on projects that challenge me and help me gain real-world experience in coding. I enjoy tackling coding problems, optimizing solutions, and building functional and visually appealing web applications. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in software engineering or web development, where I can create innovative solutions that have a meaningful impact. 
                I believe technology is constantly evolving, and I’m excited to be part of a field that thrives on creativity, efficiency, and continuous learning.
                Outside of programming, fitness plays a significant role in my life. I enjoy lifting weights, setting personal goals in the gym, and staying consistent with my workouts. I see fitness as more than just exercise—it’s about discipline, resilience, and self-improvement. Just like coding, it requires dedication and persistence, and I find that pushing myself physically helps me build the same mindset for personal and professional growth.
                In addition to fitness, I value spending time with my friends and family. Whether it's going out to eat, playing games, or just catching up, I appreciate the importance of relationships and shared experiences. I also have a deep love for music, which serves as both a creative outlet and a source of motivation. Whether I’m working on a coding project, at the gym, or just relaxing, music helps me stay focused and energized.
                Occasionally, I enjoy gaming as well. While I don’t play as often as I used to, I still find competitive and cooperative games a great way to unwind and strategize with friends. Gaming, like coding and fitness, involves problem-solving, quick decision-making, and teamwork—all of which I enjoy.
